# SLDS

This repository provides the **Self-Correcting LLM-Controlled Diffusion Sliders (SLDS)** framework, which combines:

- **SLD** (Self-Correcting LLM-Controlled Diffusion)
- **Concept Sliders**
- **Prompt Sliders**

## How to Run

To get started, open and run the `SLDS.ipynb` Colab Notebook. This notebook allows you to use the combined model with examples of both concept and prompt sliders applied to comic-style image generation.
